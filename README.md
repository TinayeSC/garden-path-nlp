# garden-path-nlp

This project is to learn about the spacy module in python, and as an introduction to NLP. This project contains a python file that has a list of garden path sentences. These sentences were worked on with the spacy module to discover the entities in the sentences and to tokenise them. Below are the codes needed for docker.

docker build -t garden-path ./
docker run garden-path
